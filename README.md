This is a simple LCD CONTROLLER for an SPI TFT LCD that I brought from ALIEXPRESS, Im using an RP2040 for the project and the PINS for them are universal as long as its the same as the original one.


Im using CircuitPython from ADAFRUIT aswell to work with their libraries and an easier flow with the code :)
Also, the project uses two libraries from ADAFRUIT, adafruit_st7789 for the communication itself and adafruit_display_text for displaying text in a simple way.
